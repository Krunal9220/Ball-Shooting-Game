# Ball-Shooting-Game


I got the idea to build this **Ball Shooting game** from this [video](https://youtu.be/eI9idPTT0c4) 

And made [My own version](https://krunal9220.github.io/Ball-Shooting-Game/) of this game using [Processing 3.5.4](https://processing.org)

## Mechanics
- There won't be more than 3 enemy balls on canvas at any time
- Enemy balls are being generated randomly on edge of canvas windows if number of balls on the canvas are less than 3
- Bullet will only be fired on clicking. So, user can't spam bullets
- There is also reloading time between any two bullets fired
- You get 5 lives on starting of the game, Life will be decreased on every enemy ball hitting middle gun-ball
